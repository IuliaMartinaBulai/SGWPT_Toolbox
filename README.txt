SGWPT toolbox: Spectral Graph Wavelet Packet Transform Toolbox
(c) Developed by Iulia Martina Bulai, Sandra Saliani

This toolbox contains code implementing the Spectral Graph Wavelet Packet Transform. The software 
implements a transform developed in the following recent paper:
[1] I.M. Bulai, S. Saliani, Spectral graph wavelet packets frames, Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 2023. 

Getting started:
- Before using the toolbox it is necessary to run sgwt_setpath.m and sgwpt_setpath.m

The Toolbox contain three folders:
- data: contains the data used for 'Brain' example and the files with the results 
- examples: this folder is composed by two subfolders: Brain and Toronto which contains the mfiles to run the 
results shown in [1]. The subfolder Brain contains also the folder 'Results' in which are saved all the 
.nii files to be visualized with Mango.  
- utils: in utils are present all the functions of the toolbox SGWPT, the toolbox SGWT (it can also be 
downloaded at page: https://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt) and the code to convert the .m files to .nii in order to be able 
to view the results in Mango.
